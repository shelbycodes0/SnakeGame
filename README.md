Classic Snake Arcade Game


I LOVED making this Classic Snake Arcade Game. 
It brings back major 2003 vibes. 😄 
I would play this on my Nokia 3310 while waiting for my mom to pick me and my friends up from the mall. 💁‍♀️
Some things haven't changed - I can't get past a high score of 15. 🙄

This is built with Python and the Turtle package.
